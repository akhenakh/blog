      <description>Here are my notes to install Arch on a Rock64 and boot on USB first.
Warning, you can brick your device (but can unbrick it), you are on your own.
 Follow Arch Instructions to Install on an SD Card Boot on it Insert your USB device and follow the exact same installation but this time to the /dev/sdadevice
At the end
Mount / into root again Run blkid to grab the UUID of your /   /dev/sda1: UUID=&amp;quot;a3490212-03b6-46a6-9e6b-7733513a3efa&amp;quot; TYPE=&amp;quot;ext4&amp;quot;  Add the file root/boot/boot.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m evaluating k3s a Lightweight Kubernetes on a rock64 (RK3328 Quad arm64).
At the time of writing the stable release is k3s v0.4.0
Here are my notes:
 If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed k3s with the install.sh, you may need to load some modules: br_netfilter and overlay Docker is not needed since k3s is using containerd but it seems I had to start docker to initialized the whole cgroups, at least on Arch For the Metrics API server to work you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start k3s with those args k3s server --kubelet-arg=&amp;quot;address=0.</description>
