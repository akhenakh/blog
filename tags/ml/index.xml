Creating a new problem It all started because as a new &amp;ldquo;forest owner&amp;rdquo;, I wanted to do a tree survey.
There are some good mobile apps to recognize flowers and trees but nothing professionally graded I knew (except paying for human expert).
I also needed a solution that would work offline since the mobile network coverage is not good on the field.</description></item></channel></rss>
