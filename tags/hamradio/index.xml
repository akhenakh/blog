      <description>One year ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started to collect temperature from my house using Acurite sensors.
These sensors are not too expensive and good quality but the &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; aka the radio receiver connected to internet is costly and totally closed, it&amp;rsquo;s sending your data to the Cloudâ„¢, it&amp;rsquo;s not just Acurite, all those &amp;ldquo;IOT&amp;rdquo; devices are generally poor on the software side.
Receiving radio data Most of these sensors have their protocols already reverse engineered you only need the radio receiver part.</description>

      <title>Streaming using a Raspberry Pi Camera to Twitch in Full HD while injecting audio from rtl sdr</title>

      <description>I have found the right setup to stream in 1080p from a Raspberry Pi using the camera to TwitchTV while injecting audio on the fly!
Create an account on Twitch and grab you stream key in the Dashboard.
This stream.sh script will create a FIFO start rtl_fm at freq 162.550M to listen to Canada weather bulletin (use your local NOAA channel) and inject and encode the audio to the existing h264 stream from the camera then stream it to twitch using rtmp.</description>

      <title>MyAPRS APRS for iPhone</title>
      <link>https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2016/myaprs_aprs_on_iphone/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce a new side project: MyAPRS, a modern iOS APRS application, for radio amateur enthusiasts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned APRS on this blog, it will mainly be useful for radio amateurs but can be interesting to RTL-SDR listeners too.
The application is built around LevelDB and geo hashing as mentioned in this post blog, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot faster than using SQLite especially on iOS, SatSat is still using the SQLite cities lookup and you can compare it&amp;rsquo;s terribly slow.</description>

      <title>Airspy on Linux</title>

      <description>Airspy is an SDR with amazing specs, but drivers are slowly coming to your prefered os.
This apply to Arch but should apply to any recent Linux.
I&amp;rsquo;ve first compiled libairspy but always had the error AIRSPY_ERROR_NOT_FOUND and &amp;quot;usbfs: interface 0 claimed by airspy while &#39;airspy_info&#39; sets config #1&amp;quot;
Since Linux 3.17 comes with an airspy v4l autoloaded driver making impossible to use it with libusb: no airspy_info and no gqrx.</description>

      <description>APRS is a tactical digital communications system used between amateurs radio, to exchange positions &amp;amp; messages, here I blog my experience decoding/encoding APRS with a small Arduino as it may help some of you too.
Some transceivers are incorporating this functionalities but most of them don&amp;rsquo;t, a lot of new technicians start with cheap Baofeng radios (30$) which don&amp;rsquo;t provide advanced functionnalities but here is a way to solve that.</description>

      <description>When I was a young child, I remember listening to an old radio receiver with my grandfather, looking for morse transmission.
30 years later, I take the opportunity to get my radio amateur license in the US, it was not difficult (Technicial license is easy), especially cause US radio amateurs are using the metric system (almost all the time &amp;hellip;), the only difficulties were to learn some terms and simple formulas from french to english and to know some parts of regulation by heart (I have never been able to learn by heart).</description>
