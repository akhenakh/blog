I like those little laptops, for the price it&amp;rsquo;s actually a very good little machine.
ChromeOS is responding very well, ssh and Chrome are working too.
But I often need more, like X11 forwarding or offline coding &amp;hellip;
You will see the C301SA is marked as a C300SA internally.
Here are the steps to install Arch Linux on it, do it at your own risk, you can brick your computer, you will need an external USB keyboard.</description></item><item><title>From OSX to Linux</title><link>https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2017/back_from_osx_to_linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 09:57:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2017/back_from_osx_to_linux/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time UNIX user, ditched Microsoft back in the 90s for FreeBSD, Solaris and Linux on the desktop, but when Apple released MacOS X, I&amp;rsquo;ve used it as a workstation.
For the last years I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux desktops but not on my main computer, today here I am switching back to Linux.
This post is not about the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m switching, they are simple.
My typical work day is mostly about parsing giant files, running VM and Dockers, coding in Go and not about developing for iOS anymore.</description></item></channel></rss>
