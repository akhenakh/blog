	<p>When I was a young child, I remember listening to an old radio receiver with
my grandfather, looking for morse transmission.</p>

<p>30 years later, I take the opportunity to get my radio amateur license in the
US, it was not difficult (Technicial license is easy), especially cause US
radio amateurs are using the metric system (almost all the time &hellip;), the only
difficulties were to learn some terms and simple formulas from french to
english and to know some parts of regulation by heart (I have never been able
to learn by heart).</p>

<p>A lot of people keep asking me why are you doing this? Do you want to speak to
a microphone to a stranger?</p>

<p>First why not, it&rsquo;s not the craziest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done :)</p>

<p>Then they probably have forgotten that every single piece of technology today
are using radio waves, from your 4G phone to wifi to Bluetooth, learning and
understanding that is really useful.</p>

<p>For example Radio amateur bands overlap some of the &ldquo;civil&rdquo; bands, it gives
some extended privileges to a radio amateur to experiment with long distance
wifi transmissions.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about voice but data too.</p>

<p>Another aspect is electronic, a lot of radio amateur are sharing hardware and
electronic circuits to build your own receiver/transceiver, before it was cool
on the Internet.</p>

<p>Learning electronic to build something real is a lot more rewarding than it
was at school&hellip;</p>

<p>Even without a license this is a brand new world to explore, <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-
receiving-noaa-weather-satellite-images/">receiving
satellite images of the Earth</a> is one of the many possibilities you
can get entering radio world.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of a new knowledge branch to conquer !</p>

<p>See my work on an<a href="http://kdl.nobugware.com/post/2014/07/28/simple-aprs"> APRS bluetooth
Modem</a></p>

<p>73 de KK6NXK</p>

<p>By the way in french it&rsquo;s radio amateur and not amateur radio :)</p>
