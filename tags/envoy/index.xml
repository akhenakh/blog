Envoy Gateway is still rough on the edges, but remember Gateway is mainly a Kubernetes API frontend to provision Envoy Proxy, Envoy Proxy configuration can still be patched to enable a specific feature.
Enable Patching Patching is not enabled by default, create this configmap if you need it:</description></item><item><title>Envoy Gateway a new Gateway API for Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2023/envoy-gateway-new-gateway-api-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 23:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2023/envoy-gateway-new-gateway-api-kubernetes/</guid><description>Envoy Proxy is a well known proxy load balancer offering HTTP, gRPC, TCP, customizable with Lua, Go, WASM &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s often the core component used to build gateways/proxies for Kubernetes. For example Istio is using it as a proxy load balancer for ingresses but also as a sidecar to create a &amp;ldquo;mesh network&amp;rdquo;.
Envoy Gateway is a more recent project to manage Envoy proxies inside Kubernetes, it is meant to be a common foundation to build on top of it, but it can be used directly as it is.</description></item></channel></rss>
